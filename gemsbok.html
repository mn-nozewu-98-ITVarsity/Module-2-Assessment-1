                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <P>The gemsbok, gemsbuck or South African oryx (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. 
It is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, such as the Kalahari Desert. Some authorities formerly included the East African oryx as a subspecies.
The gemsbok is depicted on the coat of arms of Namibia,[3] where the current population of the species is estimated at 373,000 individuals.[1] In the town of Oranjemund, gemsbok wander freely around the streets, taking advantage of the vegetation in the town, such as grass in the parks and the many trees.</P>
                    <p>Gemsbok is light taupe to tan in color, with lighter patches toward the bottom rear of the rump. Their tails are long and black in color.
 A blackish stripe extends from the chin down the lower edge of the neck, through the juncture of the shoulder and leg along the lower flank of each side to the blackish section of the rear leg. 
 They have muscular necks and shoulders, and their legs have white 'socks' with a black patch on the front of both the front legs, and both sexes have long, straight horns.
Comparably, the East African oryx lacks a dark patch at the base of the tail, has less black on the legs (none on the hindlegs), and less black on the lower flanks. 
 One very rare color morph is the "golden oryx", in which the gemsbok's black markings are muted and appear to be golden</p>

                    <p><strong>HISTORICALLY</strong></p>
                    <P>The gemsbok is polygynous, with one resident male mating with the receptive females in the herd. The male is known to secure exclusive mating access to the females by attempting to herd mixed or nursery herds onto his territory.
The gemsbok has no specified breeding season, but the young in a given herd tend to be of a similar age due to reproductive synchrony between females. Pregnant females leave the herd before giving birth. The gestation period lasts 270 days and mothers give birth to 1-2 offspring. The calf remains hidden 6 weeks after birth, after which mother and calf rejoin the herd. 
The calf is weaned at 3.5 months, becomes independent at 4.5 month, and achieves sexual maturity at 1.5â€“2 years in both sexes.</P>
