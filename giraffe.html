                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <P>The giraffe is a tall African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. 
Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.
The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its spotted coat patterns. 
It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.</P>
                    <p>The giraffe has intrigued various ancient and modern cultures for its peculiar appearance, and has often been featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. 
It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as vulnerable to extinction and has been extirpated from many parts of its former range. Giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves, but estimates as of 2016 indicate there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild. 
More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010</p>

                    <p><strong>HISTORICALLY</strong></p>
                        <P>The Kordofan giraffe (G. c. antiquorum) 
has a distribution which includes southern Chad, the Central African Republic, northern Cameroon, and the northeastern DR Congo.[1] Populations in Cameroon were formerly included in G. c. peralta, but this was incorrect.[27] Compared to the Nubian giraffe, this subspecies has smaller and more irregular spotting patterns.
Its spots may be found below the hocks and the insides of the legs. A median lump is present in males.[28]: 51–52  Some 2,000 are believed to remain in the wild.[1] Considerable confusion has existed over the status of this subspecies and G. c. peralta in zoos. 
In 2007, all alleged G. c. peralta in European zoos were shown to be, in fact, G. c. antiquorum.[27] With this correction, about 65 are living in zoos.32

The Nubian giraffe (G. c. camelopardalis),
is found in eastern South Sudan and southwestern Ethiopia, in addition to Kenya and Uganda.[1] It has sharply defined chestnut-coloured spots surrounded by mostly white lines, while undersides lack spotting.[31] The median lump is particularly developed in the male.[28]: 51  
Around 2,150 are thought to remain in the wild, with another 1,500 individuals belonging to the Rothschild's ecotype.[1] With the addition of Rothschild's giraffe to the Nubian subspecies, the Nubian giraffe is very common in captivity,
although the original phenotype is rare — a group is kept at Al Ain Zoo in the United Arab Emirates.[32] In 2003, this group numbered 14
