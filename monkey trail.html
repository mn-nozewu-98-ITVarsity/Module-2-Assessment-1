                    <h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>
                    <P>This challenging red (difficult) cross country MTB trail was first launched in 2010. The trail surface is very variable, in places expect loose stone, roots and mud. Designed with very experienced mountain bikers in mind, this trail is far more physically and technically challenging and demanding than Follow the Dog. It features bigger, stepper climbs and more technical descents.
A singletrack mountain bike trail which includes technical features and several black options. Expect flowing singletrack, medium berms, step ups, step downs, rock gardens, boardwalks, rollers, jumps and drop offs. The black difficult graded lines include large and unavoidable rocks and rock gardens.
The Monkey Trail start is reached after cycling the first 3.7km/2.29 miles of Follow the Dog Trail. The trail is managed in partnership with Chase Trails. Current highlights include Monkey’s Uncle, Upper and Lower Cliff.</P>
                    <p>Apes emerged within "monkeys" as sister of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini, so cladistically they are monkeys as well. 
There has been resistance to directly designate apes (and thus humans) as monkeys, so "Old World monkey" may be taken to mean either the Cercopithecoidea (not including apes) or the Catarrhini (including apes).
That apes are monkeys was already realized by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in the 18th century.[25] Linnaeus placed this group in 1758 together with the tarsiers, in a single genus "Simia" (sans Homo), an ensemble now recognised as the Haplorhini.[26]</p>

                    <p><strong>HISTORICALLY</strong></p>
                        <P> the word "monkey" may originate in a German version of the Reynard the Fox fable, published circa 1580. In this version of the fable, a character named Moneke is the son of Martin the Ape.[28]
In English, no clear distinction was originally made between "ape" and "monkey"; thus the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica entry for "ape" notes that it is either a synonym for "monkey" or is used to mean a tailless humanlike primate.[29] Colloquially, the terms "monkey" and "ape" are widely used interchangeably.[30] 
Also, a few monkey species have the word "ape" in their common name, such as the Barbary ape.
Later in the first half of the 20th century, the idea developed that there were trends in primate evolution and that the living members of the order could be arranged in a series, leading through "monkeys" and "apes" to humans.[31] Monkeys thus constituted a "grade" on the path to humans and were distinguished from "apes".</P>
