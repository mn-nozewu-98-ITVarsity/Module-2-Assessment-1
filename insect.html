                    <h3>INSECT HOUSE</h3>
                    <P>An insect hotel, also known as a bug hotel or insect house, is a manmade structure created to provide shelter for insects. They can come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on the specific purpose or specific insect it is catered to. 
Most consist of several different sections that provide insects with nesting facilities â€“ particularly during winter, offering shelter or refuge for many types of insects. Their purposes include hosting pollinators. Many insect hotels are used as nest sites by insects including solitary bees and solitary wasps.
These insects drag prey to the nest where an egg is deposited. Other insects hotels are specifically designed to allow the insects to hibernate, notable examples include ladybirds (ladybugs) and, arguably, butterflies.
Insect hotels are popular amongst gardeners and fruit and vegetable growers due to their role encouraging insect pollination. Some elaborately designed insect hotels may also be attractions in their own right and, increasingly, can be found in pub gardens and various tourist locations.</p>

                    <p><strong>HISTORICALLY</strong></p>
                        <P> The most common type of bee hotel is created from a wooden log, portion of a cut tree trunk or a stone block in which holes are drilled of different sizes (e.g. 2, 4, 6 and 8 mm) with the openings a few centimeters apart.
The holes are slightly tilted upwards from the opening so rainwater can drain out, and are drilled deeply into the material but not so far as to create a tunnel to the other side of the log or block. Furthermore, the entrances to these burrows must be smooth enough so that the delicate bodies of the insects are not damaged, with the exterior of wooden bee hotels being frequently sanded. The best location for a hotel is a warm and sheltered place, such as a southern-facing (in the northern hemisphere) wall or hedge. The first insects are already active towards the end of winter and would be actively seeking for such a place to settle. Other species like to furnish their nests with clay, stone and sand, or in between bricks.
Even a simple bundle of bamboo or reeds, tied or put in an old tin can and hung in a warm place, is suitable for solitary bees. The bamboo must be cut in a specific way to allow entry for the insects. Often people may add stems of elderberry, rose or blackberry shoots whose marrow can serve as a food source as well.</P>
